    "Suicides rates have been on the rise in the United States1. Understanding what factors are most correlated with suicide is important to enact laws and create more welcoming enviornments. We believe GDP will be the best predictor for suicide rates due to its connection with the econmy and people’s livelihood. Okun’s law states that an increase of unemployment by 1% leads to a decrease of gdp by 2%2. The CDC stated that financial, loss of housing, and upcoming crisis contribute to suicide. Unemployment could lead to these factors, and therefore GDP could be a good predictor for suicide.\n",

Given that this data was collected by a reputable source we can assume that it contains no biases or exclusions that would interfere with the results of our exploration.\n",
    "        \tSuicide is a very delicate subject and a result there are many possible ethical and privacy issues that we may encounter in our research. One of the main issues that may arise from using this dataset would be in terms of privacy violation, however, this would have been more of a problem if we had collected the data ourselves, but it came from the WHO and looking through the dataset, there is no information included that would violate anyone’s privacy. Our research and analysis with this data should not in any way be assumed to be a full picture of the indicators for suicide. It is simply an overview on possible factors that may have a role in why someone commits suicide. Lastly, we want to remind everyone of the national suicide prevention lifeline website https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org and phone 1-800-273-8255."

If our analysis and hypotheses are correct, we would be shedding light on different factors that may affect a persons’ decision to commit suicide and in doing so help implement different suicide prevention strategies in our communities. In specific, our hypotheses are looking at GDP as well as health as our best predicted indicators of suicide and this information could be used to implement policy change at a higher level. Even if our hypotheses end up being incorrect, we would still uncover potential factors leading up to suicide, which would in turn show us were there is potential for improvement in peoples’ quality of life and it might be useful in future research\n",

What may be a factor in one specific country may not be the same in a different one. Cultural values and schemas could affect the suicide rate, which is something we are not accounting for here. \n"
